# Movie application Disney Plus Clone

## Description

• Platform streaming content of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic for entertainment in React

• Developed using Styled-Components for CSS styling to ensure proper CSS scoping

• Utilized FireBase to store information and then be able to retrieve about the user that log in or not.

• Implemented Redux and Redux-toolkit  that actually store all the information some where then we can access it later. These allow me to saving without necessairely using the DB to saving. That may I can store information from front-end and retrieving from the front-end
